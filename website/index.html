            <h2 class="section-title">Teams Are Drowning in Fragmentation</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Your project data lives everywhere—requirements in one tool, designs in another, code in repositories, discussions in email, containers scattered across infrastructure. This fragmentation creates:</p>

                    <h3>Inefficient Communication</h3>
                    <p>Slow question-answer cycles, information lost in email threads and chat apps that exist separately from your work, meetings that could be async, context lost when discussions are disconnected from the actual data.</p>

Communication happens in dead data silos (email, chat apps) that exist separately from your actual work, losing context and creating friction.</p>

                    <h3>What is Demiurge?</h3>
                    <p>Demiurge is the integration backbone for your entire tool stack—unifying SaaS applications, containerized tools (deployed in cloud, on-premise, or on PCs), and team collaboration into one platform. It provides complete project context to AI agents, exponentializing their potential, and enables formal process checking for quality assurance.</p>

                    <h3>How does Demiurge integrate with my existing tools?</h3>
                    <p>Demiurge connects to your entire tool ecosystem—SaaS applications, cloud services, on-premise infrastructure, containerized applications, and even applications running on personal PCs. Through industry-standard APIs and a modular architecture, you can build 1:1 integration bridges to Demiurge, eliminating the need for N×N integrations between every tool.</p>

                    <h3>How does Demiurge's UI assembly work?</h3>
                    <p>Demiurge's modular architecture provides UI components from integrated apps as reusable LEGO blocks. Modules plug into Demiurge, each providing UI components from different applications. Instead of using apps as monolithic blocks, you get access to their UI components—place them where they make sense in your workflow, and build your own custom interface.</p>

                    <h3>How does cross-tool communication work?</h3>
                    <p>Unlike traditional communication tools that create separate silos (email, chat apps), Demiurge's cross-tool communication embeds conversations directly within your work context. You can have discussions within specific documents, linked to particular data points, attached to components, or connected to any part of your project graph.</p>

                    <h3>How does Demiurge "exponentialize AI potential"?</h3>
                    <p>By consolidating all project data—requirements, designs, code, tests, containers, communications, processes—into one unified graph, Demiurge provides AI agents with complete context on your complex projects. Instead of working with isolated files or fragments, AI can understand relationships, trace dependencies, analyze impact, and provide intelligent automation based on the complete picture.</p>

                    <h3>Is Demiurge open source?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, Demiurge is open source and available under a dual licensing model: free for non-commercial use, commercial licenses available for businesses.</p>
