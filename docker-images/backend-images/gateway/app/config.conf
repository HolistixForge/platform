# NOTE: The following variables are NOT set in this file because they are
# specific to each gateway container instance and are set by gateway-pool.sh
# when creating containers:
#   - GATEWAY_ID (unique per gateway)
#   - GATEWAY_TOKEN (unique per gateway)
#   - SERVER_BIND (uses gateway-specific port)
#   - GATEWAY_FQDN (unique per gateway)
# These are passed as environment variables to the container via docker run -e
