# Fluid Lifecycle Documentation

This folder contains a comprehensive white paper describing the rationales that led to the start of Holistix. These reflections were conducted under the name "fluid-lifecycle" and from an engineering background and perspective.

## Contents

- **[WHITE-PAPER.md](./WHITE-PAPER.md)** - The main white paper that explores the urgent need for an ideal project management tool specifically designed for engineering teams. It defines key characteristics of such a tool, demonstrates the feasibility of a framework for its implementation, and outlines how it consolidates project data into a Single Source of Truth (SSoT).

## Overview

The white paper addresses the challenges faced by engineering projects, including:

- Poor communication between stakeholders and tools
- Fragmented data across multiple software systems
- Inefficient processes requiring significant manual effort
- Lack of a unified view of project information

It proposes a solution framework that emphasizes:

- Single Source of Truth (SSoT) for all project data
- Seamless integration with existing software stacks
- Colocated communication within project data
- Unified user interface for all stakeholders
- Automated processes and quality assurance
- Early risk and opportunity identification
