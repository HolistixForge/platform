have specialized tools that cover part of the needs related to the coordination of stakeholders and various activities of a project.

For example, in this type of entity for each project, you will find:

- A shared folder on the network (for example on "G", "U", or "Z") with a more or less complex and up-to-date structure;
- Outlook for scheduling meetings;
- Microsoft Project for creating and tracking a schedule;
- Excel for tracking budgets, suppliers, and inventory;
- Doors or Rectify for managing/tracing and covering requirements;
- Jira for managing team activities and tracking technical facts;
- Slack for instant messaging and conferences, or simply Outlook for exchanges and reports.

### A Poor Technical Architecture

These tools do not work well together and are used by people with different responsibilities on the project, each having a partial view as their respective tools compartmentalize the data. 

Generally, it is the human element that transfers and keeps the data updated between these applications. In large groups with an information systems management department, there are often projects aimed at creating "glues," "bridges," or "gateways" between these tools to specialize them for the organization and improve the overall functioning.

More often than not, this is a lost cause, as it leads to the development of a software house of cards, full of bugs, and also forces the freezing of versions of interconnected software because the result is impossible to maintain, and the whole cannot evolve harmoniously.

### Severe Human and Operational Consequences

The fragmentation of data leads to a loss of efficiency, risks of inconsistency, forgetfulness, outdated data, and a lack of a global view of the project at the level of each tool.

```quote
"We only addressed half of the actions from the last report."

"Sorry, the specifications for such components have changed, but this has not been reflected in the documentation."

"The validation of such a feature of the developed product was not thought out in advance; we don't know how to test it."

"Oops, we didn't work from the same version."
```

No automated processing allows for alerts on a lack or risk in the project's development. To address these dysfunctions, the company introduces essentials quality assurance processes.

People generally spend as much time on the substantive development of the project as on time-consuming activities such as formalization, documentation, verification, quality assurance, reporting, etc. They spend even more time on these activities when the tools set up for them are poor. 

This situation can be represented by the diagram below, where each data flow in red is laborious and leads to loss of information, delays, follow-ups, forgetfulness, and errors.
