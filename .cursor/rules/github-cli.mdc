# GitHub CLI Integration for Cursor IDE

This workspace uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) to interact with GitHub issues and pull requests directly from Cursor. This guide explains how to set it up and use it.

## Checking if GitHub CLI is Installed

Before using GitHub CLI commands, check if it's installed:

```bash
which gh && gh --version
```

If the command fails or `gh` is not found, follow the installation instructions below.

## Installation

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/WSL)

```bash
# Add GitHub CLI repository
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg

# Add repository to sources
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null

# Update and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh -y
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install gh
```

### Windows

```bash
# Using winget
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Or using Chocolatey
choco install gh
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
gh --version
```

## Authentication

After installation, authenticate with GitHub:

```bash
gh auth login
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Choose GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Server
2. Choose authentication method (web browser recommended)
3. Authorize the CLI application

### Check Authentication Status

```bash
gh auth status
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: User Confirmation Required

**CRITICAL RULE:** Before executing ANY GitHub CLI command that modifies data (creates issues, updates issues, creates PRs, etc.), you MUST:

1. **Show the command** to the user first
2. **Explain what it will do**
3. **Wait for explicit user confirmation** before executing
4. **Never execute destructive or modifying commands** without user approval

This applies to all commands that:

- Create issues (`gh issue create`)
- Update issues (`gh issue edit`, `gh issue close`)
- Create pull requests (`gh pr create`)
- Any other command that modifies GitHub data

Read-only commands (like `gh issue list`, `gh issue view`) can be executed without confirmation, but should still be explained to the user.

## Repository Context

This workspace is connected to: `HolistixForge/platform`

Verify repository access:

```bash
gh repo view HolistixForge/platform
```

## Common Workflows

### Creating GitHub Issues

When the user wants to create a GitHub issue from Cursor:

1. **Analyze the request** - Understand what the issue is about
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Gather context, acceptance criteria, labels
3. **Draft the issue** - Create a well-documented issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Detailed description with context
   - Background information
   - Acceptance criteria (if applicable)
   - Relevant labels (if needed)
4. **Show the command and get confirmation** - Display the `gh issue create` command with all parameters and wait for user approval
5. **Create the issue** using GitHub CLI (only after user confirms):

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Issue Title" \
  --body "Issue description with markdown support" \
  --label "bug,enhancement" \
  --repo HolistixForge/platform
```

### Viewing Issues

```bash
# List all open issues
gh issue list --repo HolistixForge/platform

# View a specific issue
gh issue view <issue-number> --repo HolistixForge/platform

# View issues in web browser
gh issue view <issue-number> --web --repo HolistixForge/platform
```

### Converting TODOs to Issues

When converting TODO items to GitHub issues:

1. **Read and understand** the TODO item
2. **Ask the user** to explain the context and requirements
3. **Analyze** the TODO to determine:
   - Issue type (bug, feature, enhancement, etc.)
   - Priority and labels
   - Dependencies or related issues
   - Technical details needed
4. **Draft a comprehensive issue** with:
   - Clear title following conventional format: `type(scope): description`
   - Detailed description
   - Code examples or references if applicable
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Related context or documentation links
5. **Show the command and get user confirmation** - Display the complete `gh issue create` command and wait for explicit approval
6. **Create the issue** (only after user confirms) and provide the issue number to the user

### Example: Creating an Issue from a TODO

```bash
# Example: Create an issue for a feature request
gh issue create \
  --title "feat(ui): add responsive tab bar" \
  --body "## Description
The tab bar should be responsive to handle different screen sizes.

## Context
Currently, the tab bar doesn't adapt well to smaller screens or mobile devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tab bar adapts to screen width
- [ ] Tabs can scroll horizontally on small screens
- [ ] Touch-friendly interactions on mobile

## Related
- Related to UI hierarchy work (see TODO_ANTOINE.md)" \
  --label "enhancement,ui" \
  --repo HolistixForge/platform
```

## Best Practices

1. **ALWAYS get user confirmation** before executing any GitHub CLI command that modifies data
2. **Always verify** GitHub CLI is installed before attempting to use it
3. **Check authentication** status if commands fail
4. **Use descriptive titles** following conventional commit message format
5. **Include context** in issue descriptions - link to code, related issues, or documentation
6. **Add appropriate labels** to help with issue organization
7. **Reference issues** in commit messages using `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Not Found

If `gh` command is not found:

1. Check if it's installed: `which gh`
2. If not installed, follow installation instructions above
3. Verify PATH includes the installation directory

### Authentication Errors

If authentication fails:

1. Check status: `gh auth status`
2. Re-authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Verify repository permissions

### Repository Access Issues

If you can't access the repository:

1. Verify repository name: `gh repo view HolistixForge/platform`
2. Check if you have access to the repository
3. Ensure authentication is for the correct GitHub account

## Integration with Cursor

Cursor agents can:

- Check if GitHub CLI is installed and guide installation if needed
- Help draft well-documented GitHub issues
- Convert TODO items to structured GitHub issues
- Create issues with proper formatting and labels
- Link issues to code references and documentation

**MANDATORY for Cursor Agents:**

- **NEVER execute GitHub CLI commands that modify data without explicit user confirmation**
- Always show the command and explain what it will do before asking for confirmation
- Wait for the user to approve before running any `gh issue create`, `gh issue edit`, `gh pr create`, etc.
- Read-only commands (`gh issue list`, `gh issue view`) can be executed but should still be explained

When working with GitHub issues, always:

- **Get user confirmation before creating or modifying issues**
- Provide clear, actionable issue descriptions
- Include code references when relevant
- Link to related documentation or issues
- Use appropriate labels and assignees when known
